123 numbers shouldn't break anything.

Uh, I really like coding 😃💻, but sometimes weird things happen… like � � � characters appearing randomly. 
Also, I tried to open some files and got errors: Ã©, â, ï, ø, ñ.  
Basically, during an internship, I worked on APIs, but sometimes responses were “???” or null.  

You know, sometimes filler words are: um, uh, like… and sometimes special symbols appear: ©, ®, ™, ✓.  

Random gibberish: qweoiu123*&^%$#@!~`  
Another line with weird Unicode: 漢字, кириллица, عربى  

End of transcript… hopefully your parser handles this gracefully!
