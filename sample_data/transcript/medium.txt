So, uh, I started my journey in software development during high school. I, you know, tried a few programming languages, but I really got interested in Python and JavaScript. During college, I worked on multiple small projects, like creating task management apps and websites. Uh, in one project, I was responsible for backend development, while collaborating with frontend developers. I learned that communication is key, and teamwork really matters.

I also did an internship at a mid-sized company. There, I, um, worked on automating some scripts, testing APIs, and documenting processes. I realized that attention to detail and documentation are just as important as writing code itself. Sometimes, you know, small bugs can lead to bigger issues if not caught early.

Apart from technical skills, I focus on improving soft skills like communication, adaptability, and time management. I actively participate in team meetings, offer suggestions, and try to learn from othersâ€™ experience. Overall, I believe combining technical expertise with strong interpersonal skills makes me a better contributor to any team.
